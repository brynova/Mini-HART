# Mini-HART
The goal of this project is to create an affordable humanoid robot that will be used as an educational tool in the classroom. This humanoid can teach 9-12th grade students several aspects of STEM through its creation and use. These aspects consist of items such as 3-D modeling, design, motor control/mechanics, kinematics, programming, and other related STEM topics. This tool is to be provided to institutions in the form of a kit, which will consist of all necessary mechanical parts and 3-D printed part files. If the institution does not have access to a 3-D printer, the kit can also provide these 3-D printed parts. There will also be instructions to build and program the robot that can be understood/created by someone with limited to no prior knowledge.

Design Process:
For the lower body, there were multiple iterations of the lower body connection pieces. In the beginning, the parts were made too thin. This would cause snapping when the robot is in use. To prevent this, the part was made thicker. This was changed with the failure mode in mind. Due to the possible snapping or breakage, this could cause injury to the user. This can be caused by the part being roughly used or even accidents. The reccomended action to prevent this would be a thicker infill. Fillets were also added as a saftey precaution. Sharp edges can add injury if the user is not careful. 

The use of the AX-18A for the ankle was done due to optimizing torque.
