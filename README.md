# Mini-HART 
The goal of this project is to create an affordable humanoid robot that will be used as an educational tool in the classroom. This humanoid can teach 9-12th grade students several aspects of STEM through its creation and use. These aspects consist of items such as 3-D modeling, design, motor control/mechanics, kinematics, programming, and other related STEM topics. This tool is to be provided to institutions in the form of a kit, which will consist of all necessary mechanical parts and 3-D printed part files. If the institution does not have access to a 3-D printer, the kit can also provide these 3-D printed parts. There will also be instructions to build and program the robot that can be understood/created by someone with limited to no prior knowledge.

Design Process: For the lower body, there were multiple iterations of the lower body connection pieces. In the beginning, the parts were made too thin. This would cause snapping when the robot is in use. To prevent this, the part was made thicker. This was changed with the failure mode in mind. Due to the possible snapping or breakage, this could cause injury to the user. This can be caused by the part being roughly used or even accidents. The reccomended action to prevent this would be a thicker infill. Fillets were also added as a saftey precaution. Sharp edges can add injury if the user is not careful.

# 3-D MODELS:
The 3D models are separted between two parts being the upper body and lower body motor sections in the "Arm Parts" and "LEG Parts" 
folders with the most recent files made for project.Going into the STL within GitHub also provides a visual of what the STL file 
looks like when selected as an added feature for their vizualization.
Arm Parts:

Arm.STL - this is the link which connects the shoulder roll directional motor to the hand motor. 

Hand.STL - is the model for hand appendage of the robot which is also connected by the last roll 
directional motor of the arm's hand movement. 

Shoulder.STL - as this connection is responsible for connecting the arm of the robot to the torso, for this piece the 
motor attached to the torso is facing in the pitch direction axis. 
The placement of each of these motors are also visualized in the "Mini-HART" manual as well for the robots full set up.

In the "LEG PARTS" folder it consists of eight files with four of them starting with the labels "LL" and "UL" which stand for 
the "Upper leg" and "lower leg" of the robot. Along with the titles "Back" and "Front" for the placement 
of the part as "Back" refers to the inner placement of the robots leg, and "Front" for the outter placement of the part. 
    
LEG PARTS Folder:

LL Back.STL -
This lower leg back part is responsible for the link between the knee 
    
LL Front.STL - 
    
Left Foot.STL - 
   
Right Foot.STL - 
    
Roll.STL -
    
UL BACK.STL - 
    
UL Front.STL - 
    
Yaw.STL -
